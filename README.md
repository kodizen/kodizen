# Hi, I'm David Yates ðŸ‘‹

Enterprise microservices, web/mobile apps or Dev Ops configs for the cloud (or the 'lab) - I'm pretty much always building or learning about something new.

## Tech Stack

Hereâ€™s a snapshot of the technologies I use:

- Backend: Node.js, Docker, Go, PHP, Python, Java
- Frontend: React (and all related frameworks), Angular, Next.js, Vue (2&3)
- Mobile: Swift, Kotlin, React Native
- DevOps & Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Jenkins, AWS, Terraform, Ansible, Github Actions
- Editors: Vim is life (oh wait, no, now it's emacs). VS Code for the challenge of it.
- Other: Bash, Lua (with Hammerspoon!), and other awesome languages
